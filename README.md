## Vision
The Enigma Simulator Project aims to recreate the functionality of the historical Enigma machine, a cipher device famously used by the Germans during World War II for secure communication. This project seeks to provide an educational and interactive platform for users to explore and understand the mechanics of the Enigma machine, while also serving as a tool for encryption enthusiasts to experiment with classical cryptography techniques.

## Features
- **Rotor Simulation**: Accurately simulates the behavior of the Enigma machine’s rotors, including letter substitution based on a given wiring configuration and rotor position.
- **Reflector Mechanism**: Implements the reflector component, which ensures that encryption is a reciprocal process (encrypting the encrypted message returns the original message when the same settings are used).
- **Plugboard Configuration**: Offers a customizable plugboard feature that swaps letters before and after the rotor encryption process, mimicking the real-world Enigma machine's swappable cables.
- **Multiple Rotor Support**: Allows the use of multiple rotors in series, increasing the complexity and security of the encryption.
- **Bidirectional Encryption**: Encrypts messages by passing them through the rotors in both directions, first forward through the rotors and then reflected back.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Prompts the user to input a message and then returns the encrypted version, making it easy for anyone to experiment with encryption.
- **Customizable Settings**: Users can easily adjust rotor wirings, positions, and plugboard settings to simulate different configurations of the Enigma machine.

## Future Scope
- **Rotor Stepping Mechanism**: Introduce a feature where the rotors automatically step (rotate) after each letter is encrypted, further enhancing the encryption complexity.
- **Decryption Mode**: Implement a decryption mode that allows users to decrypt messages, provided they know the correct rotor and plugboard settings.
- **Historical Enigma Models**: Expand the simulator to include different versions of the Enigma machine, such as the four-rotor Navy Enigma or the early Enigma models.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Develop a graphical interface to make the simulator more accessible and visually engaging.
- **Online Platform**: Convert the project into a web-based application, allowing users to access the Enigma simulator from any device with an internet connection.
- **Educational Resources**: Create tutorials, documentation, and lesson plans to help educators teach the principles of cryptography and the history of the Enigma machine.
- **Security Analysis Tools**: Add features that allow users to analyze the strength of different configurations and understand potential weaknesses in the Enigma’s encryption method.
